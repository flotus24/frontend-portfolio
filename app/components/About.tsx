          I have recently graduated with a degree in Computer Science at
          Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia with a GPA of 3.76. On my final
          project as a bachelor student I made a GIS website that visualize
          drought map with next.js and also deployed my own localhost server
          with node.js and express.js. I am highly motivated, eager to learn new
          technologies and always looking for ways to improve my skills. I am
          now interested in front-end development and have worked with React,
          Next.js, Bootstrap, and Tailwind. I am also a quick learner and
          confident that I have the skills and experience that you are looking
          for in a Frontend Developer. I can handle day to day English
          conversation. I am eager to leverage my expertise and contribute to
          any company&apos;s mission and success.
